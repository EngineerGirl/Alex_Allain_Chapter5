 Question    : Write a program that provides the option of tallying up the results of a poll with 3 possible
               values. The first input to the program is the poll question; the next three inputs are the possible
               answers. The first answer is indicated by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3. The answers are
               tallied until a 0 is entered. The program should then show the results of the pollâ€”try making a
               bar graph that shows the results properly scaled to fit on your screen no matter how many
               results were entered.
